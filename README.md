## Features

Kudos (compliments) provides three features,

1. Create kudos by myself or choose from recommendations.
2. You can make a automated call with a kudo
   - When you select a kudo and type phone number, hit "SEND COMPLIMENTS".
   - It makes automatic call with a beautiful artificial voice.
   - If you want, you can set a schedule.
3. You can get a reward after sending kudos
